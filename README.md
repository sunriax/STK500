## Description

The STK500 repository is a set of library's used in the [module](https://github.com/sunriax/module) and other repositories for communication with different microchips and or semiconductors. It has been written to abstract the software from the hardware platform. Our aim is that platform can be changed (e.g. from ATmega to Microchip) without changing the developed software (like a browser). The STK500 library supports (@ the moment) only a few kind of controllers but it will increase in the future.

1. Supported Controller
   * Atmel ATmega8
   * Atmel ATmega16
   * All ATmega with same interface type
1. Development Hardware
   * STK500 ([Atmel](http://www.microchip.com/webdoc/stk500/index.html))
   * Megacard ([HTL-Rankweil](http://www.htl-rankweil.at/))
1. Additional Hardware
   * LCD Module ([HD44780](https://www.pollin.de/productdownloads/D120622D.PDF))
1. Development Software
   * Atmel Studio (uC C/C++)

## Abstraction

![Graphical Description](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sunriax/manual/master/docs/image/STK500_abstraction.png "Graphical Description")

## Getting Started

Every project has a demo application as side car (e.g. uart has uartDEMO). This demo can be used as quick start guide. We also try to keep our [WIKI](https://wiki.sunriax.at) up-to-date. Also there is a short description at the libraries folder:

* [ADC](./adc/adc.md)
* [COUNTER](./counter/counter.md)
* [IRQ](./irq/irq.md)
* [LCD](./lcd/lcd.md)
* [PORT](./port/port.md)
* [PWM](./pwm/pwm.md)
* [SPI](./spi/spi.md)
* [TWI](./twi/twi.md)
* [UART](./uart/uart.md)


## Compatibility

In the following table functions which are compatible with the function in the first row are listed.

| Function | adc | counter | irq |lcd  | port | pwm | spi | twi | uart |
|---------:|:---:|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:----:|
| adc      |     | +       | +   | +   | +    | +   | +   | +   | +    |
| counter  | +   |         | +   | +   | +    | -   | +   | +   | +    |
| irq      | +   | +       |     | +   | +    | +   | +   | +   | +    |
| lcd      | +   | +       | +   |     | +    | +   | +   | +   | +    |
| port     | +   | +       | +   | +   |      | +   | +   | +   | +    |
| pwm      | +   | -       | +   | +   | +    |     | +   | +   | +    |
| spi      | +   | +       | +   | +   | +    | +   |     | +   | +    |
| twi      | +   | +       | +   | +   | +    | +   | +   |     | +    |
| uart     | +   | +       | +   | +   | +    | +   | +   | +   |      |


(At the moment not all functions are tested in combination, so if there is any issue please feel free to report!)
